It is build by *HTML5, CSS3, Material UI, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and ReactJS (**MERN Stack***). The tools used in front-end are described below.

- **React** : React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. Please see for details (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions. Please see for details (https://material-ui.com/)
